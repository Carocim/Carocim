## Hello, I'm Carocim  
Medicine and Health Graduate | Tech Hobbyist | Self-Taught Coder

---

I'm Carocim. I recently graduated with a degree in Medicine and Health, but tech has always been something I enjoyed on the side.  
This GitHub is basically my passion project — a space where I build random tools, test out ideas, and learn things as I go.

It's not meant to be polished or perfect — just real stuff I use, things that help with my hobbies, and a brain dump for my coding journey.

What you'll mostly find here:
- Tools I made for myself  
- Projects connected to my routines or obsessions  
- Notes and mini-experiments while learning how to code  

I didn't take a formal CS path, but that never stopped me from messing around with tech and building what I need.
